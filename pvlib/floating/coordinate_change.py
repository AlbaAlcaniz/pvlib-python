    % Syntax:
    %   [Am,tilt] = coordinate_change(pitch,roll)
    %
    % Description:
    %   Perform a coordinate change from pitch and roll, which are the
    %   rotational angles in the x and y directions, to azimuth and tilt. Based
    %   on the roof to horizontal coordinate change described in Appendix E.4
    %   from the "Solar Energy" book from A. Smets et al.
    %
    % Inputs:
    %   pitch: time-resolved pitch (rotation around y axis) in degrees
    %   roll: time-resolved roll (rotation around x axis) in degrees
    %
    % Outputs:
    %   Am: time-resolved azimuth in degrees. The convention exployed is South:
    %     0째, East: 90째, North: 180째, West: 270째
    %   tilt: time-resolved tilt in degrees

        Args:
            pitch (_type_): _description_
            roll (_type_): _description_

        Returns:
